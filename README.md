# DrAdams_Task3_RedditAnalysis
This task is given by Dr. Bram Adams. In this assignment I have scrapped the reddit posts from two popular reddit repositories: [r/vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/) and [r/emacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/) by considering that the number of posts each day by any subreddit is less than 1000, and did a comprehensive graphical analysis. Another special graphical analysis has been conducted by measuring the subjectivity scores and polarity scores of the extracted texts. The code is written in Python.
