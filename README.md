# DrAdams_Task3_RedditAnalysis
This task is given by Dr. Bram Adams. In this assignment I have scrapped the reddit posts from two popular reddit repositories: [r/vim](https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/) and [r/emacs](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/) and did a comprehensive graphical analysis. Another special graphical analysis has been conducted by measuring the subjectivity scores and polarity scores of the extracted texts.
